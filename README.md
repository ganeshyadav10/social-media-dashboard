# social-media-dashboard
A Social Media dashboard enables you to measure your company’s social activities from Twitter engagement to Facebook comments to LinkedIn shares. With a dashboard, you can understand what’s working and what isn’t, and proactively work to optimize each social channel.

As Social Media becomes a more prominent medium for marketers, having a dedicated Social Media dashboard that measures activities and ROI enables Social Media marketers to become more data-driven and secure executive buy-in and budget for their initiatives.
Before you start connecting your social channels (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), pause for a moment to consider your social goals. Your goals may vary based on your business, you may want to get more budget for a paid social campaign or just widen your brand awareness on a specific channel. Regardless, the first step in measuring Social Media is understanding your measurement plan and know what the ultimate goal is.

From these goals, you can then create metrics that align with those goals and measure them. For example, if you want to measure amplification metrics like ‘Page Likes’ to measure engagement—you can measure how many likes you get on Facebook.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

yarn start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

yarn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

yarn eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
