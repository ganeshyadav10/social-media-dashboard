#SOCIAL MEDIA DASHBORD
Before you start connecting your social channels (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), pause for a moment to consider your social goals. Your goals may vary based on your business, you may want to get more budget for a paid social campaign or just widen your brand awareness on a specific channel. Regardless, the first step in measuring Social Media is understanding your measurement plan and know what the ultimate goal is.

From these goals, you can then create metrics that align with those goals and measure them. For example, if you want to measure amplification metrics like ‘Page Likes’ to measure engagement—you can measure how many likes you get on Facebook.
Metrics to Track on a Social Media Dashboard
For our example Social Media dashboard, we categorized metrics into four categories:

Amplification
Engagement
Click-through Rate
Paid
The first three categories mainly measures Brand Social, while the fourth category heavily measures campaign-specific metrics.

Amplification
Page Likes
Page Views
Page Reach
Week-over-week change between the three metrics (likes, views, reach)
Engagement
Shares on Facebook
Shares on Twitter
Shares on LinkedIn
Shares on Google+
Week-over-week change between the four channels
Click-through Rate
Percentage of Click-Through Rate (into web content from social)
Bounce Rate (into web content from social)
Paid
Number of promoted tweets
LinkedIn Sponsored Updates
LinkedIn InMails
Facebook ADs
Conclusion
As Social Media continues to be a prominent marketing medium and more Executives expect to see high-level metrics from it, you can easily create a Social Media dashboard that tracks all your channels in one place. If you would like to try building your own Social Media dashboard, you may start a free trial with Chartio here.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
